# Super Pumpkin

Super Pumpkin is a game written entirely in Lua, using the LÃ–VE framework.
The game obviously took some inspiration from Super Mario but every piece of content for the game
was created from scratch, to have just a little bit of originality.

Honestly it's just some mess I cooked up for TTHK's first Game Jam event and I had fun making it, 
even if I could've done it way better now that I think about it.

## Installation
1. Head into releases -> <latest release>
2. Download the release and extract it wherever you want to store the game
